World Setting

The game is set in North America, 70 years after the collapse of civilization. Much of the world has undergone radical changes, with the environment and the creatures that inhabit it mutated by the aftermath of a global disaster.

The game begins in the state of Arizona, where players will be thrust into a harsh and unforgiving world where survival is the key to success. The landscape of Arizona has been transformed by the disaster, with formerly populated areas now overgrown with vegetation and mutated creatures roaming the land.

As players venture beyond Arizona, they will discover a world that has been transformed in many different ways. Some regions will be characterized by extreme weather conditions, such as the frozen wastelands of the north or the scorching deserts of the south. Other regions will be dominated by new forms of life, such as forests of twisted trees and mutated beasts.

The remnants of the old world can still be found throughout the game world, with abandoned cities, military bases, and research facilities serving as sources of valuable resources and information. However, these areas are also fraught with danger, as they are often infested with zombies or controlled by raiding humans and mutant creatures.

As players explore the world, they will encounter various factions and groups that have emerged in the wake of the disaster. Some of these factions will be friendly and offer assistance, while others will be hostile and must be fought or avoided.

Overall, the world of the game is a dark and dangerous place, where players must navigate a complex web of threats and opportunities to survive and thrive.
