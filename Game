Title: Another Apocalypse Game

Genre: Open world RPG


Setting: 

The game is set in North America, 70 years after the collapse of civilization. Much of the world has undergone radical changes, with the environment and the creatures that inhabit it mutated by the aftermath of a global disaster. The disaster was unknown and still remains a mystery to this day.

The game begins in the state of Arizona, where players will be thrust into a harsh and unforgiving world where survival is the key to success. The landscape of Arizona has been transformed by the disaster, with formerly populated areas now overgrown with vegetation and mutated creatures roaming the land. Some of the zombies have adapted to their environment and can go into torpor, making them even more dangerous.

As players venture beyond Arizona, they will discover a world that has been transformed in many different ways. Some regions will be characterized by extreme weather conditions, such as the frozen wastelands of the north or the scorching deserts of the south. Other regions will be dominated by new forms of life, such as forests of twisted trees and mutated beasts.

The remnants of the old world can still be found throughout the game world, with abandoned cities, military bases, and research facilities serving as sources of valuable resources and information. However, these areas are also fraught with danger, as they are often infested with zombies or controlled by raiding humans and mutant creatures.

In addition to zombies, gangs of human survivors roam the wastelands, fighting for scarce resources and struggling to stay alive in a world that seems determined to snuff out all hope. Power armor is one of the few means of protection against the relentless attacks of the undead, and scavenging for supplies is a constant necessity. Players have the option to join or create factions, each with their own goals and ideals, and establish bases in strategic locations across the map.

As players explore the world, they will encounter various factions and groups that have emerged in the wake of the disaster. Some of these factions will be friendly and offer assistance, while others will be hostile and must be fought or avoided. The choices made by players have a significant impact on the world and gameplay, shaping the narrative and the world around the player in unexpected ways.

Overall, the world of the game is a dark and dangerous place, where players must navigate a complex web of threats and opportunities to survive and thrive.
